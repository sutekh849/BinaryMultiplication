# Interview question practice

This is a simple program that implements a binary multiplication system without using the * operator. 
Instead it makes use of bit shifts to do long division of numbers at a binary level. There might be more efficient ways of doing this, but I wanted to avoid using stackoverflow!

Stored here for my own future reference.
